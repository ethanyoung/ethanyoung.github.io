I have an existing Vue.js app that have [vuex-oidc](https://github.com/perarnborg/vuex-oidc) and want to migrate it into [single-spa](https://single-spa.js.org/) to apply a micro-frontend framework.

[qiankun](https://github.com/umijs/qiankun) is a wrapper on single-spa. So I decided to use qiankun for the single-spa migration.

## Migrate Vue.js routing

## MIgrate vuex-oidc configuration
